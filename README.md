# Console Finances Challenge

## Description

This activity presents a real-world situation in which JavaScript skills are required. The goal is to write the code to analyse the financial records of a company.

## Goals

Using the dataset made up of 2D arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

The goal is to use JavaScript to calculate the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset.

2. The net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period.

3. The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

6. Your final code should print the analysis to the console.

When launched in the browser, the resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 25
  Total: $2561231
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```
